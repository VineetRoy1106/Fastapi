Pearson Correlation:

Correlation Coefficient: 0.994

This indicates a strong positive linear relationship between previews (pageviews) and clicks.

P-Value: 0.0

The result is statistically significant, confirming the correlation is unlikely due to chance.

R-Squared: 0.988

Approximately 98.8% of the variability in clicks is explained by the linear relationship with previews.

Interpretation:

The analysis strongly supports that previews (pageviews) and clicks are linearly related.
A well-fitted linear regression model can reliably predict clicks from previews.
